# Number Conversion and Calculator 

## Description

This Python program provides a user-friendly interface to perform number conversion and calculations. It supports the conversion of numbers between decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary formats. Additionally, it includes a matrix calculator and prime calculator with various functionalities.

The Number Conversion Calculator allows you to convert numbers from one format to another. Whether you have a decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary number, you can easily convert it to any other supported format. The program handles the conversions and displays the results promptly.

The Matrix Calculator enables you to perform operations on matrices. You can perform matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and other operations. Detailed instructions on using the matrix calculator are provided in the program.

The Prime Calculator assists in prime number-related calculations. It can determine prime factors, calculate the greatest common denominator (GCD), and find the lowest common multiple (LCM). The prime calculator is designed to provide accurate results for various input numbers.

## Features
Number Conversion Calculator:

Converts decimal numbers to binary, hexadecimal, and octal.

Converts hexadecimal numbers to decimal, binary, and octal.

Converts octal numbers to decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.

Converts binary numbers to decimal, hexadecimal, and octal.

Matrix Calculator:

Performs matrix addition: Add two matrices of the same size together by adding corresponding elements.

Performs matrix subtraction: Subtract one matrix from another of the same size by subtracting corresponding elements.

Performs matrix multiplication: Multiply two matrices together following the matrix multiplication rules.

Performs scalar multiplication: Multiply a matrix by a scalar, which multiplies each element of the matrix by the scalar value.

Performs matrix transposition: Transpose a matrix by interchanging its rows and columns.

Calculates the determinant: Calculate the determinant of a square matrix.

Calculates the inverse: Find the inverse of a square matrix if it exists.
